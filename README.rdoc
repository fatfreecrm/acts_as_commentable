= Acts As Commentable

A maintained fork of the original acts_as_commentable gem.

Provides a single Comment model that can be attached to any model(s) within your app. It creates
a Comment model and handles the plumbing between that model and any models that you declare to be
commentable models.


== Installation

Add the following line to your Gemfile

  gem 'acts_as_commentable2', require: 'acts_as_commentable'

This should be a drop in replacement for acts_as_commentable, with only the package name changed and dependencies improved.

Choose the appropriate tag for your rails version.
 
== Generator


=== Rails

  rails g comment

Then migrate your database to add the comments model:

  rake db:migrate

== Usage

Make the desired ActiveRecord model act as commentable:
 
  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_commentable
  end

Add a comment to a model instance by adding the following to the controller:
 
  commentable = Post.create
  comment = commentable.comments.create
  comment.title = "First comment."
  comment.comment = "This is the first comment."
  comment.save


Fetch comments for the commentable model by adding the following to the view:
 
  commentable = Post.find(1)
  comments = commentable.comments.recent.limit(10).all

You can also add different types of comments to a model:
 
  class Todo < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_commentable :public, :private
  end

*Note:* This feature is only available from version 4.0 and above

To fetch the different types of comments for this model:

  public_comments = Todo.find(1).public_comments
  private_comments = Todo.find(1).private_comments


By default, `acts_as_commentable` will assume you are using a `Comment` model.
To change this, or change any other join options, pass in an options hash:

    class Todo < ActiveRecord::Base
      acts_as_commentable class_name: 'MyComment'
    end

This also works in conjunction with comment types:

    class Todo < ActiveRecord::Base
      acts_as_commentable :public, :private, { class_name: 'MyComment' }
    end
